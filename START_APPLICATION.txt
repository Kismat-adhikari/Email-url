QUICK START (Windows):
----------------------

1. START BACKEND (Python Flask Server):
   Open Command Prompt or PowerShell in the project root folder and run:
   
   python app_anon_history.py
   
   ✓ Backend will start on: http://localhost:5000
   ✓ Wait for message: "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000"


2. START FRONTEND (React Application):
   Open a NEW Command Prompt or PowerShell window
   Navigate to the frontend folder:
   
   cd frontend
   npm start
   
   ✓ Frontend will start on: http://localhost:3000
   ✓ Your browser should open automatically
   ✓ If not, manually open: http://localhost:3000


IMPORTANT NOTES:
----------------
• Keep BOTH terminal windows open while using the application
• Backend MUST be running before frontend for full functionality
• If you see "Failed to fetch" errors, check that backend is running
• Press Ctrl+C in each terminal to stop the servers


TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------

Problem: "python: command not found"
Solution: Make sure Python is installed and added to PATH
         Try: python3 app_anon_history.py

Problem: "npm: command not found"
Solution: Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/

Problem: Backend won't start
